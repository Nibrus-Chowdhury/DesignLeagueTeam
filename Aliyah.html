    <h3>Brainstormer</h3>

    <p> Hi! My name is Aliyah and I am the team's brainstormer.This subject is important to me because like my peers, I like to code and design new things. Brainstorming is one of the key things in designing and developing anything, such as websites, apps, and games. With my team, I work with their ideas for our game and we work together to come up with a plan for the game. I also help to brainstorm key components of the game, such as some of the screens and the mood of the game.  </p>
